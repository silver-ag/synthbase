# SynthBase

a generic modular synth, modules can be written that operate on any kind of data and then used in a graphical environment 
(although currently it only really has video synthesis modules written). written because i keep starting [datatype]-synth
projects and getting bogged down implementing the generic parts. once it's more complete there'll be proper documentation,
but for now it'll start up in an environment where you can right click to instantiate modules.
